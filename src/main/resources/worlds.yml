# Configuration file for the AUTO REPLENISH feature for individual worlds.
#
# ====================================================================================================
# IMPORTANT: This configuration only works when shared-mode is FALSE in config.yml
# ====================================================================================================
# When shared-mode is TRUE in config.yml:
#   - All settings in this file are IGNORED
#   - Chests use global shared mode with shared-refill-time from config.yml instead
#
# When shared-mode is FALSE in config.yml:
#   - These settings control per-player refill timers
#   - Each player gets their own unique loot that refills independently
# ====================================================================================================
#
# By default, all worlds will use the settings defined in "default-configuration" for auto-replenishment.
# To customize settings for a specific world, duplicate the "default-configuration" section and
# rename it to match your world's name, and adjust the settings as needed.
# NOTE: The "max-refills" and "refill-time" options are applied on a per-player basis.
#       Player requires "lootin.autoreplenish" permission for their auto replenish to work.

default-configuration:
  # Enables automatic replenishment of loot containers for individual players after a set period.
  auto-replenish-enabled: false
  # If false, custom loot containers created with the "/lootin set" command will not auto-replenish.
  replenish-custom-containers: false
  # The maximum number of times a loot container can refill.
  # Set to -1 for unlimited refills.
  max-refills: -1
  # The time interval between loot container refills.
  # Supported units are days (d), hours (h), minutes (m), and seconds (s).
  refill-time: 14d
  # Resets the loot seed each time a container is refilled, randomizing the items for each refill.
  reset-seed-on-fill: true
  # list of loottables lootin will ignore, in other words containers with these loottables will not turn into lootin chests
  # list of vanilla loottables can be found here https://github.com/sachingorkar102/Lootin-plugin/blob/main/vanilla-loottables.txt
  # Pro tip:
    # use NAME$ to take those loottables into account which end with "NAME" eg. "_treasure$"
    # use ^NAME to take those loottables into acccount which start with "NAME" eg. "^minecraft:chests/" (this will black list all chest loottables from minecraft namespace)
    # use "ALL" in the list to disable all structures in the world, this is useful when you want to use lootin only for custom chests.
